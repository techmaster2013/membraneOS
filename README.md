# THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE: THIS IS NOT A FINISHED REPOSITORY!

## membraneOS (Modified from NautilusOS)

membraneOS is a fork of NautilusOS, and is a web-based operating system built in HTML, CSS, and JS.
Boot it up, log in, and mess around like it’s a real desktop with web browsers, games, apps, an app store, windows, a file explorer, taskbar, and more!

- allows creation of multiple accounts with different editable  permissions (superuser or standard users)
- THREE built in proxy browsers, all using different technologies
- tons of themes to customize Nautilus to your preference
- fully animated desktop environment  
- draggable + resizable windows
- notifications and a quick action menu
- built in screenshotting, media viewing, music playing and more
- taskbar to keep your apps organized
- custom right-click menu to quickly perform tasks within Nautilus
- searchable start menu with user info and apps grid

## 💡 more about

This is mostly just a fun UI sandbox with no backend or external data storage. It just seemed like the logical next step after Helios Browser.  
Everything runs client-side.  
Built with just HTML, CSS, and JS (no frameworks, no CDNs except icons/fonts)

## 🧠 try it

Open the NautilusOS-OneFile/index.html file in your browser. That’s it.
